## API Reference
Welcome to the AQA Skeleton Program Emulator API reference.
This is an easy-to-understand codebase rewritten from the original skeleton program, with commenting for all relevant methods and fields throughout the project.

*Note: Ignore anything in the "AQASkeletronPlus.GUI" namespace, as that is for the visualizer.*
